        <p>
          Apicatando is a small business that produces and sells artisanal honey locally in Candeleda, Spain.
        </p>
        <p>
          They needed branding, a simple website and photography to showcase their products and emphasize their eco-friendly and natural production process.

            <p>
              Since they only sell honey locally, an online shop wasn’t necessary for them. Instead, we focused on creating a simple and easy to navigate website where their target audience (locals in their rural town) can access the information they are looking for. With its responsive design, Apicatando can be viewed easily on all devices and screens, ensuring their brand exhibits consistency and reliability to its visitors 24/7.

              By studying their business ecosystem and target audience, we organized their web content in a way that made sense for its users. We adapted previously written content to emphasize the products they sell, their work ethic and the family behind the business, all things that are important to their local customers.

              The high definition photos we took give their website and business the professional quality they were searching for. With their eco-friendly production process and family as principal values of their business, we sought out to provide a glimpse into both their professionally work with the bees and personal life with their family.
